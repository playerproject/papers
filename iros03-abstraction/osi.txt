%% this is a helpful sumary of the OSI model 

%% Layer 1 - Physical

%%     Physical layer defines the cable or physical medium itself, e.g.,
%% thinnet, thicknet, unshielded twisted pairs (UTP). All media are
%% functionally equivalent. The main difference is in convenience and
%% cost of installation and maintenance. Converters from one media to
%% another operate at this level.  Layer 2 - Data Link

%%     Data Link layer defines the format of data on the network. A
%%     network data frame, aka packet, includes checksum, source and
%%     destination address, and data. The largest packet that can be sent
%%     through a data link layer defines the Maximum Transmission Unit
%%     (MTU). The data link layer handles the physical and logical
%%     connections to the packet's destination, using a network
%%     interface. A host connected to an Ethernet would have an Ethernet
%%     interface to handle connections to the outside world, and a
%%     loopback interface to send packets to itself.

%%     Ethernet addresses a host using a unique, 48-bit address called
%% its Ethernet address or Media Access Control (MAC) address. MAC
%% addresses are usually represented as six colon-separated pairs of hex
%% digits, e.g., 8:0:20:11:ac:85. This number is unique and is associated
%% with a particular Ethernet device. Hosts with multiple network
%% interfaces should use the same MAC address on each. The data link
%% layer's protocol-specific header specifies the MAC address of the
%% packet's source and destination. When a packet is sent to all hosts
%% (broadcast), a special MAC address (ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff) is used.  Layer
%% 3 - Network

%%     NFS uses Internetwork Protocol (IP) as its network layer
%%     interface. IP is responsible for routing, directing datagrams from
%%     one network to another. The network layer may have to break large
%%     datagrams, larger than MTU, into smaller packets and host
%%     receiving the packet will have to reassemble the fragmented
%%     datagram. The Internetwork Protocol identifies each host with a
%%     32-bit IP address. IP addresses are written as four dot-separated
%%     decimal numbers between 0 and 255, e.g., 129.79.16.40. The leading
%%     1-3 bytes of the IP identify the network and the remaining bytes
%%     identifies the host on that network. The network portion of the IP
%%     is assigned by InterNIC Registration Services, under the contract
%%     to the National Science Foundation, and the host portion of the IP
%%     is assigned by the local network administrators, locally by
%%     noc@indiana.edu. For large sites, usually subnetted like ours, the
%%     first two bytes represents the network portion of the IP, and the
%%     third and fourth bytes identify the subnet and host respectively.

%%     Even though IP packets are addressed using IP addresses, hardware
%% addresses must be used to actually transport data from one host to
%% another. The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used to map the IP
%% address to it hardware address.  Layer 4 - Transport

%%     Transport layer subdivides user-buffer into network-buffer sized
%% datagrams and enforces desired transmission control. Two transport
%% protocols, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram
%% Protocol (UDP), sits at the transport layer. Reliability and speed are
%% the primary difference between these two protocols. TCP establishes
%% connections between two hosts on the network through 'sockets' which
%% are determined by the IP address and port number. TCP keeps track of
%% the packet delivery order and the packets that must be
%% resent. Maintaining this information for each connection makes TCP a
%% stateful protocol. UDP on the other hand provides a low overhead
%% transmission service, but with less error checking. NFS is built on
%% top of UDP because of its speed and statelessness. Statelessness
%% simplifies the crash recovery.  Layer 5 - Session

%%     The session protocol defines the format of the data sent over the
%% connections. The NFS uses the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) for its
%% session protocol. RPC may be built on either TCP or UDP. Login
%% sessions uses TCP whereas NFS and broadcast use UDP.  Layer 6 -
%% Presentation

%%     External Data Representation (XDR) sits at the presentation
%% level. It converts local representation of data to its canonical form
%% and vice versa. The canonical uses a standard byte ordering and
%% structure packing convention, independent of the host.  Layer 7 -
%% Application

%% Provides network services to the end-users. Mail, ftp, telnet, DNS,
%%     NIS, NFS are examples of network applications.
