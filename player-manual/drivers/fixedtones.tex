\subsection*{Synopsis}
The {\tt fixedtones} driver provides access to sound hardware, via the Linux
OSS interface.  Incoming sound is put through a Discrete Fourier Transform,
and the frequencies and amplitudes of the five highest peaks in the frequency
domain are determined.  Note that the {\tt FFTW} library is required; this
package is available (also under the GNU GPL) from: {\tt http://www.fftw.org}.
The {\tt fixedtones} driver can also produce fixed-tone sounds of given
frequency, amplitude, and duration.
