\subsection*{Synopsis}
 The {\tt lifo\_mcom} driver provides a last-in-first-out (LIFO)
 multi-stack communication system with which clients can exchange data
 through an instance of Player.

 If Pop is called, the last piece of data that was Pushed to the named
 channel is returned and then deleted.  If Read is called the last piece
 of data added is returned, and left there.  Since this is a LIFO stack,
 if we're reading drive commands, for example, we can be sure to get a
 "STOP" and interrupt a "FWD" before it's been read.
