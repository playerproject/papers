\subsection*{Synopsis}
 The {\tt service\_adv\_mdns} driver publishes a service record for a robot 
server using multicast DNS ("Rendezvous"), which is part of the IETF draft
standards for "Zeroconf". This driver uses the Howl library and daemons 
(see http://www.porchdogsoft.com), and requires Howl to build.  Don't forget to
run the "nifd " (on Linux) and "mDNSResponder" daemons.  The robot server is published with service
type "\_player.\_tcp." For each device on the robot, an entry will
be added to the service text record, like this: 
{\tt device={\it interface}\#{\it number}({\it driver})}. 
 
The service advertisement drivers provide no interface to clients.
