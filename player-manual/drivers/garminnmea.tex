\subsection*{Synopsis}

The {\tt garminnmea} driver controls a Garmin handheld GPS unit, via a
RS232 link.  The driver was developed using the Garmin Geko 201, but
it should work with other Garmin units.  It is unlikely to work with
non-Garmin GPS units, as at least one proprietary Garmin NMEA
sentences is being used.

This driver is also capable of operating the unit in DGPS mode using
RTCM corrections.  The driver listens on a network socket for RTCM
packets generated by a remote DGPS base station; the packets are
forwarded over the serial port to the GPS unit, which responds by
switching into DGPS mode.  The {\tt dgps\_server} utility found in the
{\tt utils/dgps\_server} directory may be used to generate RTCM
corrections; corrections are transmitted to clients using UDP
multicast.
